      <p>alittle about me, i started out young, I was about 9 when i found out i was able to draw what I see. So i moved on from that to drawing cartoons. i fell in love with the idea of do cartoons. When I was a teen my life started going south, and in my 20's I had a moment where art saved my life, now i am getting better, and still love art, still drawing cartoons and more</p>
